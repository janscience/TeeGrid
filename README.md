# TeeGrid

Record electric fish with electrode arrays based on
[Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontrollers.

Based on the [TeeRec](https://github.com/janscience/TeeRec) library,
inspired by Stefan Mucha's
[EOD-Logger](https://github.com/muchaste/EOD-Logger), the
[ESensors](https://github.com/janscience/ESensors) library, abd the
[Teensy_Amp](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp) amplifiers.

## R4 logger with sensors

Logger for 2 to 16 channels based on
[Teensy_Amp R4.1](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.1) or
[Teensy_Amp R4.2](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.2) with additional environmental sensors. [Read more](examples/R4-sensors-logger/).
