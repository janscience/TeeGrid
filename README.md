# TeeGrid

Record electric fish with electrode arrays based on
[Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontrollers.

Based on [TeeRec](https://github.com/janscience/TeeRec) library,
inspired by Steafan Mucha's
[EOD-Logger](https://github.com/muchaste/EOD-Logger).


## 8-channel logger

Not really a grid yet, but a first step towards it. [Read
