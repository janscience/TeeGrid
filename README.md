# TeeGrid

Record electric fish with electrode arrays based on
[Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontrollers.

Based on [TeeRec](https://github.com/janscience/TeeRec) library,
inspired by Stefan Mucha's
[EOD-Logger](https://github.com/muchaste/EOD-Logger).


## R4 logger

Logger for 4 to 16 channels based on [TeensyAmp
  R4.0](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.0), [R4.1](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.1), or [R4.2](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.2). [Read
  more](R4-logger/).


## 8-channel logger

Not really a grid yet, but a first step towards it. [Read
more](8channel-logger/).


## 8-channel logger with sensors

A variant of the [8-channel logger](8channel-logger/) that
supports a variety of environmental sensors. [Read
more](8channel-sensors-logger/).

## Resources

Ideas to solve the syncrhonization problem of multiple loggers:

- [Low-cost synchronization of high-speed audio and video recordings
  in bio-acoustic experiments](https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.173724)
- [Bio-acoustic tracking and localization using heterogeneous,
  scalable microphone
