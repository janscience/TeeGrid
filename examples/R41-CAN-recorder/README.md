# R4.1 CAN Recorder

An electrode array assembled by a number of 8 or 16 channel recorders
based on [Teensy_Amp
R4.1](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.1),
optionally expanded by [Teensy_Amp
R4.2](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.2).  This
is the code for each of the recorders. For controlling the recorders,
see [R41-CAN-controller](../R41-CAN-controller).

Designed by Jan Benda in September 2023.
