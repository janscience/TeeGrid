# R4.1 CAN Recorder Controller

An electrode array assembled by a number of 8 or 16 channel recorders
based on [Teensy_Amp
R4.1](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.1),
optionally expanded by [Teensy_Amp
R4.2](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp/tree/main/R4.2).  This
is the code for the first of the recorders that records its electrodes
and synchronizes the grid via CAN bus. For the other recorders use
[R41-CAN-recorder](../R41-CAN-recorder).

Designed by Jan Benda in September 2023.
